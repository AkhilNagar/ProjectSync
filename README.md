Title: Online integrated platform for projects taken up by the students of various universities/colleges
(Smart India Hackathon 2023) 

Team: Akhil Nagar, Ishika De, Hetvi Gudka, Yashvi Donga, Sanyukta Joshi, Avish Rodrigues

Proposed Solution:
1) There exists University profiles which will display all ongoing projects that the students are working on.
2) Using automation and AI, we can read the ReadMe file and create a summary of the project and assign necessary domain tags to the project which will be displayed on the portal.
3) Using these tags, we create a ML recommendation system for students from other universities to browse similar projects.
4) In order to curb plagiarism, we will introduce a plagiarism check between codebases to ensure no two projects have the exact same code.
5) Students can search, filter and query project ideas based on their domain interest. There will be an option for students to be able to see/contact the team if they wish to contribute to the open source project or not.
6) There will be a feed such that a student can subscribe to the project of their liking and keep upto date with the latest developments. They can leave feedback and comments too!
7) This project also serves as a breeding ground for startup innovation and people/organisations can fund/provide grants to certain projects based on scope/viability.
8) It'll help students learn and build over the current approaches that already exist.
9) The platform will allow collaboration inter-college hence creating a strong community of passionate coders.
10) A blog/communication platform for students to come together for ideation and networking opportunities.
